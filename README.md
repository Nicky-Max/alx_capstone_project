# Project Overview:

- Hello, in this video, I'll be showing you the project I've been working on, which includes a game. You'll see a dashboard with a button that leads to a quiz. Each question has a 15-second timer, and you can select an option before time runs out. After answering, the right answer is highlighted in green and the wrong answer in red. The quiz keeps track of your progress and awards points at the end. I'll also walk you through the code I used, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

# Features and Functionality:

# Technologies Used:

- I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build this application
